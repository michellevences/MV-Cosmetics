        <h2>Skintype</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>For Oily Skin:</strong>
          <br />
          Look for products containing alpha hydroxy acids (glycolic acid or
          salicylic acid), benzoyl peroxide, and hyaluronic acid. "These
          ingredients are effective at controlling excess sebum production while
          hyaluronic acid will produce hydration only in areas needed," Dr.
          Green says.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For Dry Skin:</strong>
          <br />
          Look for products containing shea butter and lactic acid. "These
          ingredients provide hydration and mild exfoliation to keep dry skin
          looking radiant," Dr. Green says.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For Sensitive Skin:</strong>
          <br />
          Look for products containing aloe vera, oatmeal, and shea butter.
          "They're good moisturizers and usually don't break anyone out," Dr.
          Green says
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Still Not Sure?</strong>
          <br />
          If you're not 100 percent sure what skin type you have, it's worth a
          trip to the dermatologist to confirm. Once you understand your skin
          type, you can start selecting products with more precision.

        <h2>Concealer</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>How To Pick A Concealer Shade:</strong>
          <br />
          The rule of thumb for picking your concealer shade is based on your
          foundation shade. Beauty experts advise that everyone should have two
          shades of concealer in their arsenal, one lighter and one darker since
          daily sun exposure means your skin tone shifts slightly all the time.
          Plus, makeup artists use multiple shades of concealer for different
          end effects
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong>
          <br />
          Concealer is used to help cover imperfections, not even skin tone, so
          its best to apply foundation first.

        <h2>Contour 101</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 1:</strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Choose Your Contour Product</strong>
          <br />
          When contouring, we want to choose shades that imitate the realistic
          shadows of your face, so keep that in mind when choosing your
          products.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 2:</strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Carve the Cheekbones </strong>
          <br />
          To enhance your cheekbones, makeup artist Asta Jurksaite suggests
          drawing a line starting from the top of your ear and moving toward
          your nose, ending right where your eye starts. When blending, buff the
          product upward. "Blending the product up will help to lift your
          features, while blending downward will appear to drag your face down,"
          notes Khan.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 3:</strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Define the Hairline</strong>
          <br />
          Jurksaite recommends gliding the product along both sides of your
          hairline (without connecting them in the middle) and adding a short
          line on your temples, right where the brows endâ€”this can create the
          illusion of a higher, diamond-shaped hairline.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Step 4:</strong>
          <br />
          <strong>Define the Jawline</strong>
          <br />
          Sculpt that jawline. Trace short lines along the angles of your jaw,
          ending at the same point as those cheekbone lines above. If you'd like
          to shorten the face, you can also trace the bottom of your chin with a
          small line, but this is entirely optional
